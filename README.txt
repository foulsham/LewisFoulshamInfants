# LewisFoulshamInfants
Original and modified infant faces from Lewis, Roberson and Foulsham (2017; PLOS One).

Original stimuli were provided by Katherine Karraker, as reported in the following paper:
Hildebrandt KA, Fitzgerald HE. Facial feature determinants of perceived infant attractiveness. Infant Behav Dev. 1979; 2: 329–339. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0163-6383(79)80043-0

There are 49 unique infants (see Thumbnails.pdf). Each of them has been modified to create the abnormality versions. Modified stimuli were edited using GIMP to add haemangioma, cleft lip or strabismus. In the case of strabismus, approximately half of the infants have strabismus of the left eye (and the rest an abnormal right eye). In the case of haemangioma, each infant has both left and right versions but the vertical position of the abnormality (upper or lower hemiface) is manipulated between infants. 

All stimuli have been re-sized to be 450 pixels in height. Some stimuli may have been horizontally flipped.


Each filename contains:
a number (which originally represented the age of the infant, in months)
a letter (infant's sex)
a number (the ID of this infant, in cases where there are several of the same sex/age)

and a suffix according to the presence of an abnormality:
C = cleft lip
LS = strabismus in the left eye (observer’s left)
RS = strabismus in the right eye (observer’s right)
LLH = left lower haemangioma
RLH = right lower haemangioma
LUH = left upper haemangioma
RUH = right upper haemangioma

e.g.,
13M1.jpg: a male infant without abnormality
13M1LS.jpg: the same infant with strabismus of the left eye
